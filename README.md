# ps_sql_automated_restore
PowerShell module for automating backup restores from one server to another. 

I wrote this to help make my life a little easier at a previous job. I was constantly asked to restore Prod backups to UAT and I wrote this to automate the process as much as I could. I ended up leaving that job not much longer after I finished writing it and I only ended up using it about 10 or so times before I left. It worked well, there were (and probably still are) some bugs in the code, but it's 'mostly' functional. Feel free to make it way better than it is. 

If it isnt obvious, this module relies heavily on dbatools.
